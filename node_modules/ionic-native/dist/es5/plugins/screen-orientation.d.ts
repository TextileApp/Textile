/**
 * @name Screen Orientation
 * @description
 * Cordova plugin to set/lock the screen orientation in a common way for iOS, Android, WP8 and Blackberry 10.
 * This plugin is based on an early version of Screen Orientation API so the api does not currently match the current spec.
 *
 * Requires Cordova plugin: `cordova-plugin-screen-orientation`. For more info, please see the [Screen Orientation plugin docs](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-screen-orientation).
 *
 * @usage
 * ```typescript
 * import { ScreenOrientation } from 'ionic-native';
 *
 *
 * // set to either landscape
 * ScreenOrientation.lockOrientation('landscape');
 *
 * // allow user rotate
 * ScreenOrientation.unlockOrientation();
 * ```
 *
 * @advanced
 *
 * Accepted orientation values:
