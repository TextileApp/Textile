/**
 * @name LocationAccuracy
 * @description
 * This Cordova/Phonegap plugin for Android and iOS to request enabling/changing of Location Services by triggering a native dialog from within the app, avoiding the need for the user to leave your app to change location settings manually.
 *
 * @usage
 * ```
 * import { LocationAccuracy } from 'ionic-native';
 *
 * LocationAccuracy.canRequest().then((canRequest: boolean) => {
 *
 *   if(canRequest) {
 *     // the accuracy option will be ignored by iOS
 *     LocationAccuracy.request(LocationAccuracy.REQUEST_PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY).then(
 *       () => console.log('Request successful'),
 *       error => console.log('Error requesting location permissions', error)
 *     );
 *   }
 *
 * });
 *
 * ```
