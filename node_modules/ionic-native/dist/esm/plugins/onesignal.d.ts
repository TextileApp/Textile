 * @description
 * The OneSignal plugin is an client implementation for using the [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) Service.
 * OneSignal is a simple implementation for delivering push notifications.
 *
 * Requires Cordova plugin: `onesignal-cordova-plugin`. For more info, please see the [OneSignal Cordova Docs](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/phonegap-sdk-installation).
 *
 * @usage
 * ```typescript
 * import { OneSignal } from 'ionic-native';
 *
 * OneSignal.startInit('b2f7f966-d8cc-11e4-bed1-df8f05be55ba', '703322744261');
 *
 * OneSignal.inFocusDisplaying(OneSignal.OSInFocusDisplayOption.InAppAlert);
 *
 * OneSignal.handleNotificationReceived().subscribe(() => {
 *  // do something when notification is received
 * });
 *
 * OneSignal.handleNotificationOpened().subscribe(() => {
 *   // do something when a notification is opened
 * });
 *
 * OneSignal.endInit();
 * ```
